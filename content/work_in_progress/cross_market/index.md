title: "Mergers With Intermediation: The Price Effect of Distant Hospital Mergers"
summary: "With [David Dranove](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/dranove_david.aspx) \n\n Employers buy insurance on behalf of employees, aggregating several hospital service markets in a single procurement process. Hospital systems controlling key employer geographies can leverage it in rate negotiations with insurers. Can this explain mounting evidence of cross-service-market merger price effects?"
