I am the Class of 1943 Career Development Assistant Professor at the [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/benjamin-vatter) in the Applied Economics group. My research focuses on competition and policy design, with emphasis on healthcare markets. 

I got my Ph.D. in Economics from Northwestern University in 2022.
