We measure the impacts of vertical integration between insurers and hospitals. In the Chilean market, where half of private hospital capacity is vertically integrated, integration increases inpatient care spending by 6 percent and decreases consumer surplus and total welfare. Integrated insurers offer generous coverage at integrated hospitals, limited access to rival hospitals, and lower premiums. Competition for enrollees forces non-integrated insurers to provide additional coverage to high-quality non-integrated hospitals, resulting in plan networks that limit hospital competition. Whereas vertical integration reduces double marginalization, skewed cost-sharing structures-and their effect on hospital competition-more than compensate, leading to an overall negative welfare impact.
