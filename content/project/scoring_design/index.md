 Informing consumers of the product quality alters their demand and, therefore, firms' incentives to invest in quality. By leveraging this mechanism, regulators could coordinate quality disclosure and regulation policies, reduce spending, and improve welfare. I study how to design policies that inform consumers and regulate quality using information alone. Combining data and theory, I examine the design of one of the most extensive disclosure programs in the United States: the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings. Quality heterogeneity in this health insurance market is considerable, costs billions in subsidies, affects population health, and is difficult to assess without additional disclosure. I specify and solve an optimal scoring design problem for this market and find an alternative welfare-improving design. The new scores use the same data as the Star Ratings, are less complex, shift demand towards higher quality, induce higher investments by firms, reduce government spending, and address a common multitasking problem. The analysis provides insights into why quality certifications are effective, what governs the coarseness of disclosure policies, and why informational campaigns accompany successful disclosure policies. Overall, my alternative design increases total welfare by $650 per Medicare beneficiary year, with half of the gains stemming from better information and half from higher induced quality.
